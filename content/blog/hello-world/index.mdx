Here's my first post on my personal website!

To be honest, I'm not completely sure what my goals are here, but I suppose this is a start. I really just want a place to throw some of my thoughts in order to make them feel a bit more tangible. Those might include code examples, physics/math visuals, poems, rants, or really anything else. I'll probably try to categorize posts as things get added.

The site itself is built with Gatsby, a static site generator, which uses tools including React (front end framework), GraphQL (data layer), and MDX (content). I'm also using ThemeUI for theme building and simple React components, along with CSS-in-JS for styling. Take a look at the code on [my github](https://github.com/lambertbrady/bradylambert 'Brady Lambert GitHub repository')!
